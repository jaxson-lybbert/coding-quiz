# coding-quiz
## Description:
The purpose of this program is to present the user with a list of coding related questions that will keep track of how many the user gets right or wrong. It was made using CSS, HTML, and JavaScript, with jQuery syntax. I faced a lot of challenges when it came to the event listeners and getting them to fire in the correct order. I was not able to get some of the major functionality of the program to work properly. The user is able to input their initials and score at the end of the quiz, and it will save to local storage. But that infromation will not display on the high scores page. I was also not able to get the timer properly integrated.

## How to Use:
Simply launch the app and test your knowledge!
